Initial Purpose
---------------
   The initial proposal was to develop a frontend application to consume Marvel and Google Maps APIs.
The application should be a Single Page Application (SPA) for querying comics using the Marvel API for data collection.
The application should contain a list of comics, a modal detailing the comics and sending the comics to an address selected on the map through the Google Maps API.

The Challengers  
---------------
   I found many challenges when carrying out this application, among them the use of a new framework for me, Angular, can be highlighted. Even knowing about the principles of frontend development, using a new framework was really exciting. Furthermore, it was the first time I consumed these APIs in question, having to learn each one of them step by step to get the best result in my application. Furthermore, I was being limited by time, as I only had 72 hours to carry out this project, as it would be presented in a job vacancy. All in all, this project gave me a lot of learning and being able to do something really cool in a short period of time.

Conclusion
----------
      
It can be concluded that it was a really challenging project due to the time factor, but that it gave me many positive experiences, as well as new knowledge. Learning a framework, reviewing the concepts of html, css and typescript, as well as learning to consume a highly relevant API in the market, which is Google Maps. It really was a very good experience, however, there is still a long way to go to be a complete application. For future updates, they may have a search bar, an e-commerce simulation or even a visual improvement.
